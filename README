NoUTube
=======

YouTube subscription aggregator and organiser.

Written using PHP with the CodeIgniter framework.

Uses the Zend GData and PHPass libraries.

Requirements
============

 - PHP 5.2.x or higher
 - Apache2 mod_rewrite for URLs without "index.php"

Installation
============

You'll need to modify these variables in application/config/config.php to get started:

 - $config['base_url']
 - $config['index_page'] (if using mod_rewrite, which is not necessary)
 - $config['encryption_key'] and $config['sess_secure'] (if using secure sessions, which is not necessary)
 - $config['sess_user_database'] (if storing sessions in a database, which is not necessary)
 - $config['cookie_domain'] and $['cookie_path']

Next you'll need to set up a database. Any DBMS supported by CodeIgniter should work.

Create a table 'users' with the following fields:
 - username, varchar(16)
 - hash, char(60)
 - token, text

Lastly you'll need to add the database connection details to application/config/database.php.

If you want to store session data in a database too, refer to the CodeIgniter Sessions documentation.

If you're going to be pushing commits back to github, you don't want to your personalised config files to be included. While you can simply not add them to the commit, I suggest running the following commands to make git ignore changes made:
 git update-index --assume-unchanged application/config/config.php
 git update-index --assume-unchanged application/config/database.php
